# Workoutizer

The Workoutizer is a simple web application for organizing your workouts and sports activities. It is designed to work
locally on any system running Python. Track your activities to get an overview of your overall training, similar to
platforms like [strava](https://www.strava.com/) or [garmin connect](https://connect.garmin.com/) - but without
uploading all your sensitive health data to some 3rd party cloud.

## Getting Started

To run the application, just clone the repo, navigate into the root of the repo and run

```bash
docker-compose up
```
